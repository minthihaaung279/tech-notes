As an Android developer in Myanmar, having the right tools can significantly boost your productivity and the quality of your work. Here's a breakdown of what I consider essential:

## 1. Android Studio: Your Command Center

The official IDE from Google is indispensable. It comes packed with everything you need, from a powerful code editor to an emulator and profilers.

_Why it's essential:_

- Integrated debugger
- Layout Inspector for UI debugging
- Performance profilers

## 2. Git & GitHub: Version Control is King

Every professional developer needs to master version control. Git allows you to track changes, collaborate, and revert to previous states. GitHub is the best platform to host your Git repositories.

Learning Git early will save you countless headaches and is a must-have for any job application.

## 3. Figma: For UI/UX Design

Even if you're not a designer, understanding basic UI/UX principles and using a tool like Figma can help you visualize your app ideas.
